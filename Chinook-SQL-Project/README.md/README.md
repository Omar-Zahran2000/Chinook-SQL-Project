# Chinook SQL Project – Sales and Customer Insights

In this project, I explored customer and sales data from the Chinook digital music store using SQL in PostgreSQL. The goal was to simulate real-world business questions that a data analyst might encounter — focused on revenue generation, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Tools I Used
- PostgreSQL (via pgAdmin)
- SQL (aggregations, JOINs, GROUP BY, window functions)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

---

## Key Questions I Answered
- What are the top-selling music genres?
- Who are the top customers by total purchases?
- How much revenue is generated by each sales employee?
- What’s the average invoice amount by country?
- Which countries have the most transactions?

## Sample Insights
- **Rock** is the most profitable genre, generating over $826 in total sales — more than double the next genre, Latin.
- **Jane Peacock** is the top-performing sales agent, responsible for over $833 in revenue, followed by Margaret Park and Steve Johnson.
- **Helena Holý**, **Richard Cunningham**, and **Luis Rojas** are the top 3 customers by total spend.
- **Chile, Hungary, and Ireland** had the highest average invoice totals, each exceeding $6.50 per transaction.
- **The USA and Canada** recorded the highest number of transactions, with 91 and 56 respectively, while France and Brazil followed closely with 35 each.
